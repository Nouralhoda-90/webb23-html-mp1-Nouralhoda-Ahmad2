        <p>Actually, my name is Nour Al-Huda, but this is only official. Since I was a child,
            I know my name is Noura, and I did not know my official name until I started going to school
            I grew up in a small family with only a mother, father and sister. Nevertheless,
             I was social. I was known in my school for my liveliness and social participation.
            Every year my class students chooses me as their class representative, and this for sure made feel satisfied.
            My family and their health are the most precious thing I have.</p>

        I was born on October 18, 1990, of Palestinian origin,
         but the country of my birth and upbringing is Iraq. 
        There I studied and finished the high school. 
        In Cyprus I studied computer engineering and there I met my life partner.
        Together we came to Sweden to start our beautiful family. Today I am a mother of a daughter, Linn, and a son, Qais.
